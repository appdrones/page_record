#Intro
You've probably been there. You're building your killer Web Application. You, being a responsible developer, your code is thoroughly tested. You are using the likes of cucumber and Rspec to do so. Besides your unit-tests, you also have integration tests doing a full stack test. You are using Capybara to read, parse and test the rendered pages. You use all kinds of selectors to select different parts of the page. Slowly but surely your test code becomes less and less readable.

##[PageRecord](http://rubydoc.info/github/appdrones/page_record/PageRecord) can help.
There are a lot of ways you can do this. [PageRecord](http://rubydoc.info/github/appdrones/page_record/PageRecord) is one of these ways. [PageRecord](http://rubydoc.info/github/appdrones/page_record/PageRecord) is an ActiveRecord like abstraction for information on the HTML page. 

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/appdrones/page_record/wiki) for usage.  See the [example](https://github.com/appdrones/page_record_example) for more details. Check [Changes](https://github.com/appdrones/page_record/blob/master/CHANGES.md) for (breaking) changes per version.

## Installation
